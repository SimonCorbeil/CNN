# CNN
Exemple of cnn using python and tensorflow to count fingers shown in an image

Nota bene: 
1) When orginizing the images data in order to train and validate the CNN, 
you must include in a folder (pointed by the set_path (see line 2 train_cnn.py) ) 
all the images exemples. Each labeled image, of a given category, must be regrouped
in a folder named by the label of the category.
